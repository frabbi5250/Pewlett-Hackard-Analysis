# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project was to create tables: one to determine the retiring employees and their position titles, and the other to identify employees who are able to participate in a mentorship program. Within the first table, employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date were included. In the second, employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title were included.
